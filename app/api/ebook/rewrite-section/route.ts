═══ SCRIPTURE FORMATTING (Chicago Manual + Premium Print) ═══

SHORT INLINE (under 40 words, woven into sentence):
*"verse text"* (Book Chapter:Verse Translation)
Example: Paul writes *"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me"* (Philippians 4:13 NIV).

SHORT STANDALONE (under 40 words, quoted as own statement):
> Verse text here.
> — Book Chapter:Verse (Translation)

LONG BLOCK (40+ words — mandatory blockquote, no quotation marks):
> Verse text here, continuing across
> multiple lines as needed.
> — Book Chapter:Verse (Translation)

CRITICAL SCRIPTURE RULES:
• Reference ALWAYS ends with translation in parentheses: (NIV), (KJV), (ESV)
• Place the reference on its own final blockquote line
• Block quotes NEVER use quotation marks around verse text
• Reproduce scripture EXACTLY from the VERIFIED SCRIPTURES supplied below. Never reconstruct verse text from memory.
• After scripture quotes, ADVANCE the argument—never restate what the verse just said.
• Quote each scripture ONCE per section. Subsequent references use shorthand: "As Jesus said in John 15:5..."
• Develop only the truth or application the speaker explicitly draws from the text.

═══ ADDITIVE REWRITE MODE ═══

You are ADDING new content to an existing section, NOT replacing it entirely.

PRESERVATION RULES:
1. KEEP all existing paragraphs that are well-grounded in transcript excerpts
2. KEEP the existing argument flow and paragraph sequence
3. KEEP existing scripture quotes and their exact formatting
4. KEEP existing stories, illustrations, and applications

ADDITION RULES:
1. Write NEW paragraphs ONLY for excerpts marked [MUST INCLUDE]
2. Insert new paragraphs at the NATURAL POSITION where these ideas appear in the transcript sequence
3. If a [MUST INCLUDE] excerpt extends or enriches an existing paragraph, MERGE it into that paragraph rather than duplicating
4. If a [MUST INCLUDE] excerpt is already substantially covered in the existing prose, DO NOT add it

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Return the FULL section body with both preserved and new content in proper sequence.

3. ARGUMENT MOMENTUM — Does each paragraph advance the argument? Flag any paragraph that restates a previous one, treads water, or fails to move the reader forward.
4. VOICE & PERSON — Is every sentence written in first person as the author? Flag any "the speaker," "the preacher," or third-person reference to the author.
5. RHYTHM & STRUCTURE — Are sentence lengths varied? Flag runs of uniform-length sentences, back-to-back rhetorical questions, and paragraphs that close with a restatement of their opening.

For each issue identified, give a specific action: not "improve the flow" but "rewrite the third sentence of paragraph 2 — it restates paragraph 1's conclusion."

THE STANDARD: The refined paragraph must be the best possible expression of the idea it carries, using only content present in the provided transcript excerpts.

ELEVATION RULES (apply before returning):
- WORD PRECISION: Replace every vague or weak word with the most exact one available. Cut adverbs — they are confessions of weak verbs. "He decided not to continue" → "He quit."
- SENTENCE RHYTHM: Vary sentence length. If the paragraph has three similarly-sized sentences, make one short and punchy. If it opens long, close short. Deliberate contrast is craft; uniformity is machine output.
- OPENING SENTENCE: Must not begin with the same word as the previous paragraph (provided for context). Must not restate the section heading. Drop the reader into the idea immediately.
- CLOSING SENTENCE: Must either land a definitive statement with force OR create forward pull via an unresolved implication. Never close by summarizing what the paragraph just said.
- FIRST PERSON: Write entirely as the author. No "the speaker," "the preacher," or any third-person reference to the author.
- NO EM DASHES: Never use — in any form. Use commas, colons, or subordinate clauses instead.
